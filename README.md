# rock-paper-scissors
This will be a very basic rock-paper-scissors prompt game created with javascript. First using math.random, the computer will generate a random number from 1-3 and assign "rock", "paper", and "scissors" to their corresponding number. Next a text box will appear prompting the user to enter either "rock", "paper", or "scissors" themselves. There will be a total of 5 rounds of the game; during each round the players score and computers score will be incremented depending on who has won the round. In the event of a tie, nobody is awarded points. At the end of the 5 rounds a message will be displayed confirming the overall winner and loser based on who accumulated more points during the game.
